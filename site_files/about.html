    <h1>Hi!</h1>

    <p>A few weeks ago, a friend of mine had their account hacked on Discord. The attacker socially engineered them into changing their recovery email. They recovered their account since, but I wondered, how could companies prevent this? And well, this is the demo of that very idea!</p>
    <p>Goal: Even though no company will likely see this, my goal is for companies to implement safe guards like this! A little warning can go a long way. I hope my message make somes change :D</p>
