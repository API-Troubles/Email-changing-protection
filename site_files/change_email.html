    <h2>Scam Prevention Warning</h2>

    <p>Please Read: Answer these questions by yourself. Don't let anyone else tell you how to answer. There are horrible people who want to take over your accounts to take money or other things from you. If you are unsure or feel pressured by someone, feel free to contact our support team.</p>

    <p>Be Careful! Make sure if your being told by family or friends, that this is actually them! People online can take over their accounts and pretend to be them.</p>

    <p><b>You are changing your email to {{ email }}.</b></p>
